# Cybersecurity Policies
<h2>Repository Overview</h2>
This repository houses comprehensive cybersecurity policies, guidelines, and best practices designed to protect the organization’s information systems, data, and networks from unauthorized access, breaches, and other security threats. These policies aim to create a secure development environment, uphold data integrity, and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The goal of these cybersecurity policies is to establish a consistent security framework across the organization’s technology infrastructure. They are tailored for software developers, system administrators, security teams, and all employees who interact with sensitive data or IT assets. These policies foster a culture of security awareness, risk management, and proactive defense against cyber threats.

<h2>Core Areas Covered</h2>

<h3>Access Control and Authentication</h3>
<ol>Policies on identity management, role-based access, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and least-privilege principles to secure system access.</ol>
<ol>Requirements for GitHub user permissions and protected branches to prevent unauthorized changes.</ol>

<h3>Data Protection and Privacy</h3>
<ol>Guidelines on handling, storing, and sharing sensitive data within code repositories.</ol>
<ol>Encryption standards for data at rest and in transit to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.</ol>
<ol>Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) for handling personal data.</ol>

<h3>Secure Development Practices</h3>
<ol>Best practices for secure coding, including input validation, error handling, and mitigation of common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).</ol>
<ol>Code review protocols to catch potential security issues early in the development cycle.</ol>
<ol>Requirements for dependency management, vulnerability scanning, and third-party library assessments.</ol>

<h3>Change Management</h3>
<ol>Procedures for code changes, including mandatory pull requests, approvals, and logging of significant changes.</ol>
<ol>Incident tracking for code-related security vulnerabilities or breaches and mitigation measures.</ol>
<ol>Documentation standards for version control and repository management.</ol>

<h3>Incident Response and Logging</h3>
<ol>Steps for identifying, reporting, and mitigating security incidents that involve the repository or related systems.</ol>
<ol>Logging and monitoring policies to detect unusual activities, with specific triggers for alerting the security team.</ol>

<h3>Third-Party and Open-Source Component Management</h3>
<ol>Security requirements for evaluating and using open-source libraries, including a risk assessment of dependencies.</ol>
<ol>Policies for regularly updating and patching dependencies, with a focus on preventing supply chain attacks.</ol>

<h3>Security Awareness and Training</h3>
<ol>Expectations for team members’ cybersecurity training, including best practices for secure development and GitHub usage.</ol>
<ol>Resources for staying informed on emerging threats and secure coding techniques.</ol>

<h2>Compliance and Review</h2>
All policies are aligned with industry standards such as NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls and are reviewed regularly to incorporate changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and technology advancements.

<h2>How to Use This Repository</h2>
Each policy document includes a clear purpose, scope, and step-by-step procedures. Users are encouraged to read, implement, and regularly revisit these policies to ensure ongoing adherence to secure practices. Contributions to improve these policies are welcome, following secure coding and review guidelines.
